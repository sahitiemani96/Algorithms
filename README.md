# Dijkstra-s-Algorithm-To-calculate-the-shortest-path-using-a-maze
Intuition behind Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm The vertices in increasing order of their distance from the source vertex. Construct the shortest path tree edge by edge; at each step adding one new edge, corresponding to construction of shortest path to the current new vertex.
